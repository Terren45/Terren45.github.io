I decide to study Software Engineering to pursue a career that would allow me to spend more time with my family and to earn more money.  My current job is physcially demanding and I've been doing this for 21 years. I've tried to change before but every time I woudl try something in life would change. Things from family situtations, auto accidents to health issues. I first heard about coding from a customer while doing my current job and my fiance also talk to me about it before. I looked in to it but as life would have it something happen. My son was born and I just stayed put but now its time.
I found Flatiron with the help of Career Karma and I think this was meant to be.
