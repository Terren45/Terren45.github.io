  My new journey into Software Engneering will be such a great adventure.   Hello my name is Terren. I'm 45 years old and I've been working my current job for 21 years. I'm a father of a 4 year old and life is good. But with my current career I don't have much time with family. So I'm starting this new journey so I can start a new career that will allow me more time with my family an also make some more money!! I've always said if I had a child I would like to be in a position so I could make all their school activies and  be there for all their sport activies. My son is my heart. I love spending time with him,  teaching him new things and taking new places. I'm praying that by learning to become a software engineer will give me that opportunity. 
	
	 I choose software engineering because coding peek my interest. I know some people that have learned how to code and I felt like I could learn coding. And with Flatirons software engineering program I felt like it was a good fit. With the  part time online program I felt that I could work and complete that program at the same time. I have to talk about my beautiful fiance is by my side for that 10 month journey. Our wedding was schedule for May 2 of this year but because of the pandemic we had to postone our wedding until next year. Heartbreaking!! However, I hope to have this program done and have started my new job by then. So that a little bit about my life. Has Grace go, I'll go!!
